    ## üß† Design Notes

    This project was conceived with distributed systems resilience in mind and tailored specifically for "ALIVE-Quantumthoughtprocessor" in the "quantum_thought_processor" domain, implemented in Python.

    ## üìê Architecture Sketch

    - Modular components with clear boundaries
    - Strong typing and validation where applicable
    - Observability and logging baked in
    - CI-ready with sensible defaults

    ## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

    - [ ] Extend examples and tutorials
    - [ ] Add benchmarks and profiling
    - [ ] Improve documentation coverage
